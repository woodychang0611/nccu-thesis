\chapter{Introduction}

Based on investors' preferences, Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) can produce a portfolio with maximum expected return from a given risk\cite{10.2307/2975974}. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the popular approaches for advanced portfolio management systems. However, although many RL-based portfolio management systems optimize the model using risk-adjusted measures\cite{cogneau2009101}, few of these measures provide the parameter to represent investor's risk preferences. As a result, incorporate investors' risk preferences like MPT will be a challenge for RL-based portfolio management systems.
