\chapter{Introduction}

Based on investors' preferences, Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) can produce a portfolio with maximum expected return from a given variance\cite{10.2307/2975974}. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the popular approaches for advanced portfolio management systems.  However, despite many RL-based portfolio performances uses measures that are risk-adjusted\cite{cogneau2009101}, like the Shape ratio\cite{Sharpe49} or the Sterling ratio\cite{magdon2004maximum}. Unfortunately, these measures do not provide the parameter to represent investor's risk preferences. As a result,  few RL-based portfolio management systems incorporate investors' risk preferences like MPT.
