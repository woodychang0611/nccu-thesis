\section{Conclusions}
The experiment results demonstrate that the system can build portfolios with different MDD upon the same validation period using various thresholds. 


\section{Extensions}

There are many opportunities to enhance to optimize the reward function. Due to the uncertainty of the finance market, our system can provide a qualitative result. Adjusting the threshold with investors' preference and the status of the market dynamic could give a more predictable and reliable performance.

As we focus on the reward function to the DRL model, we use vanilla complement for the rest of the system. Improving them will have great potential to enhance the performance of the system. For example, there is room to improve feature processing or investible universe.

\par
We can also extend our system to other investors' preferences. Risk preference is only one category of investors' preference. A similar approach can apply to different preferences, for example, the opinion of the investor used in Blackâ€“Litterman model\cite{black1992global}. The system will offer portfolios to meet investors more.
