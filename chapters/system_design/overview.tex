\section{Overview}
\autoref{fig:context_diagram} represents the overview and workflow of our proposed DRL-based Portfolio Management System.
The system will output portfolios based on the inputs, the market the investment universe, and investor preference. 
\par
The system contains two main parts, the DRL model and the trading environment. We will detail discuss about them in \autoref{c:drl} and \autoref{c:trading_environment}. The trading environment bridges domain-specific inputs/outputs with the general-purpose DRL model. This architecture enables the system to function with most existing DRL models with ease.
