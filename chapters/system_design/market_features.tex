\section{Market Features}
The model uses structured information from the market as its data source, including interest rates, commodity prices and currency exchange indexes. (\autoref{appendix:features_list}).
\par
We assume features change slowly like interset rates will represent the macroeconomics status and features change rapidly, e.g., VIX will express the emotion of the market and effect of incoming news.

\par
For stationary data, we will use them directly as features. For non-stationary data, we use statistics measures among 5, 20, and 60 days as features, including standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
\par
Features are collected and calculated beforehand and stored in files for further usage. They will be used as part of the inputs to construct the trading environment used for training and validation.
