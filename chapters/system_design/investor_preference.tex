\section{Investor Preference}
For investor preference, we will focus on the risk aversion of the investors. Usually, professional personnel or organization will acquire risk aversion from investors by survey or other techniques and interprets the inputs into comparable indicators between investors. Our system will use these indicators as the goal to build the portfolios to meet investor risk aversion. MDD as be one of the indicators to evaluate our system. However, optimizing any ratio using MDD directly has many problems and challenges. Some researches indicate MDDs are outliers \cite {johansen2002large, johansen1998stock} or imply optimizing MDD is troublesome \cite{moody1998performance}. Therefore, we will not limit ourselves to use MDD while optimizing the model and consider other alternatives.
