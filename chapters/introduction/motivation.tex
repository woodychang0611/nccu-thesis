\section {Motivation}
We can get a portfolio with maximum expected return from a given variance, an indicator of risk, or vice versa, the minimal variance from a given expected return with Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) \cite{10.2307/2975974}, to fulfill different investors' preference.
Although many portfolio performance measures are risk-adjusted\cite{cogneau2009101}, like the Shape ratio\cite{Sharpe49} or the Sterling ratio\cite{magdon2004maximum}. To our knowledge, few RL-based portfolio management systems incorporate investors' risk preferences. Constructing portfolios based on investors' risk preferences with these systems will be a challenge for RL-based portfolio management systems.
