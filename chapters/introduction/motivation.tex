\section {Motivation}
Psychologically, humans favor avoiding losses to acquire equivalent gains. This tendency is called Loss Aversion.\cite{kahneman2000analysis} Kahneman's study suggests losses are twice as powerful as gains\cite{Tversky1992}.
We can construct a portfolio that produces the maximum expected return from a given variance, an indicator of risk, or vice versa, the minimal variance from a given expected return with Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), \cite{10.2307/2975974} to fulfill different investors' preference.
Although many portfolio performance measures are risk-adjusted\cite{cogneau2009101}, like the Shape ratio\cite{Sharpe49} or the Sterling ratio\cite{magdon2004maximum}. To our knowledge, few RL based assert allocation systems incorporate with investors' risk preferences. Constructing portfolios based on investors' risk preferences with these systems will be challenging.
