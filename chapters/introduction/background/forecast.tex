\subsection{Supervised Learning Forecast System}
Supervised learning is a popular approach for forecast systems. Christopher Krauss successfully used various machine learning techniques, including deep neural networks, gradient-boosted-trees, and random forests, to create ensembles predicting the S\&P 500 index that out-performed the general market\cite{KRAUSS2017689}.

Thomas Fischer brings deep learning to the next level by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network\cite{FISCHER2018654}. His model demonstrates LSTM can effectively extract meaningful information from noisy financial time series data and beat other machine learning models in Christopher Krauss's article\cite{KRAUSS2017689} for most situations, except the crisis in 2009, where Random Forest perform better than LSTM.
