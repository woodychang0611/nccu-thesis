\subsection{Asset Allocation System via Reinforcement Learning}
One major issue of the supervised forecast system is the system using the forecasts to build the portfolio does not use inputs for the forecast system, result in loss of information.

John Moody and Lizhong Wu introduced Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the trading system \cite{618952}. Trading systems trained via RL can incorporate market features with trading cost effects, e.g., transaction costs and taxes, and outperformed trading systems trained via supervised learning with labels. For utility function, they observed maximizing the differential Sharpe ratio yields more consistent results than maximizing profits\cite{618952}.
