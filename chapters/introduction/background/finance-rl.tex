\subsection{Asset Allocation System via Reinforcement Learning}
John Moody and Lizhong Wu introduced Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the trading system \cite{618952}. Trading systems trained via Reinforcement learning can incorporate the effects of transaction costs and taxes. The result of such systems outperformed trading systems trained via supervised learning with labels. For utility function, they observed maximizing the differential Sharpe ratio yields more consistent results than maximizing profits\cite{618952}.\\
