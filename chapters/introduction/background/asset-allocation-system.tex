\subsection {Asset Allocation System}
Asset allocation is an approach to produce a collection of assets, also known as a portfolio, based on the state of the market, available assets, and investors' preferences.

The asset allocation system aims to build an optimal portfolio, which does not merely maximize the return but maximizes the utility based on investors' preferences. Among these preferences, risk preference is one of the significant factors.

Traditionally asset allocation can be divided into two steps. The first step produces the forecasts. The second step builds the portfolio based on the forecasts.  Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), introduced by  Harry Markowitz \cite{10.2307/2975974} focus on the second stage. Machine Learning (ML) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) can complete both stages in a single process and construct portfolios that out-performed the general market\cite{KRAUSS2017689, moody2001learning}
