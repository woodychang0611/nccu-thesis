\subsection{Risk Measure}
Risk is an abstract concept, and there are many indicators to represent the risk. We will discuss some of them here. 
\subsubsection{Standard Deviation}
We can measure the volatility of the return with the standard deviation. The well known Sharpe Ratio uses the standard deviation to represent a risk. The downside for the standard deviation of return is assets that produce a blooming return that most investors seek will also yield a high standard deviation.
\subsubsection{Maximum Drawdown}
Drawdown is the decline from the highest peak. Maximum drawdown (MDD) is the maximum loss from the peak over the given period. The Sterling ratio uses MDD as an indicator of the risk.
