\section{Risk-Adjusted Measures}
There are many portfolio performance measures.\cite{cogneau2009101,cogneau2009more,cogneau2009more2}
Risk-Adjusted measures incorporate risk into the measure of performance for finance investments and reflect investors' nature better than using return along.
We will discuss a few of them over here.
\subsubsection{Sharpe Ratio}
Sharpe Ratio\cite{Sharpe49} is one of the most well-known risk-adjusted measure. It represent amount of return per unit of variation, or risk.\\
The revision version is defined as
\[ SR = \frac{E(R_a - R_b)}{\sigma_a},
\sigma_a = \sqrt{VAR(R_a-R_b)}\]
where \(R_a\) is the return of the assert, 
\(R_b\) is the risk-free return,
\(E(R_a - R_b)\) is the expected excess return of the assert,
and \(\sigma_a\) is standard deviation of the excess return.
One downside of the Sharpe Ratio is that it penalizes occasional high returns\cite{9206647}.
\subsubsection{Sterling ratio}
Sterling ratio\cite{magdon2004maximum} uses max drawdown (MDD) over a given period to represent the risk; this resolves the issue Sharpe Ratio has with occasional high returns. 
There are many forms of Sterling ratio; one common definition\cite{magdon2004maximum} is defined as 
\[ SR = \frac{E(R_a - R_b)}{MDD - 10\%}\]
%\subsubsection{Calmar ratio}
%Calmar ratio\cite{young1991calmar} replace empirical max drawdown with the expected maximum drawdown \(E(MDD)\), defined as 
%\[C_T = \frac{E(R_a - R_b)}{E(MDD)}\]


\subsubsection{Other Measures of Performance}
There are many other Sharpe ratio variations, like Burke Ratio, Martin Ratio, or Pain Ratio\cite{bacon2009sharp}. Furthermore, Philippe Cogneau and Georges HÃ¼bner censused the 101 performance measures for portfolios. Many of the measures are risk-adjusted measures\cite{cogneau2009101,cogneau2009more,cogneau2009more2}.
