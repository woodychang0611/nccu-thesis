\section{Objective}
\label{c:objective}
RL is a compelling and popular approach for driving portfolio management systems. But, unfortunately, it will be a challenge for these systems to provide optimal user experience to investors if the system optimizes with the same objective function.

We aim to design a DRL-based portfolio management system to build portfolios that fit investors better by considering their risk preferences and target two objectives.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Provide a parameter to incorporate investors' risk preferences.
    \item Outperform a constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP) which represents the portfolio suggested by the advisor. 
\end{enumerate}
