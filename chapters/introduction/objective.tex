\section{Objective}
RL is a compelling and popular approach for driving portfolio management systems. But, unfortunately, it will be a challenge for these systems to provide optimal user experience to investors if the system optimizes with the same objective function.

We aim to design a DRL-based portfolio management system to build portfolios that fit investors better by considering their preferences, specifically risk preferences. Surveys or other techniques by professional personnel or organization will interpret investors' risk preference to comparable indices. Traditionally, an advisor will suggest a portfolio with fixed weights based on these indices.
Our system will start from the same indices and target two objectives.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Provide a parameter to incorporate investors' risk preferences.
    \item Outperform a constant rebalanced portfolio which represents the portfolio suggested by the advisor. 
\end{enumerate}
