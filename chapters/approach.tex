\chapter{Approach}
\section{Related Works Study}
We will study works about asset allocation systems related to investors' risk preference or reinforcement learning model. The goal is to understand better the requirement, challenges, and opportunities for our asset allocation system.
\section{Implementation}
We will then design and implement our system, including the input/output interface, utility function, with a deep reinforcement learning model. We will use an indicator to represent investors' risk preferences to adjust the utility function and adopt one of the existing commonly used and advanced models for the deep reinforcement learning model.
\section{Training and Validation}
After implementing the design, we will define the market features as inputs for the system and select investments from the investable universe to build the portfolio. The goal is to choose investments with low correlations between each other; hence their combinations can yield better profits from the same risk level. We will split available data into two parts, the first part used for training and the rest for validation. 
\section{Conclusions and Extensions}
The final step is to analyze the validation result to identify our design's strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, we will explore some extensions for further improvement in our proposed portfolio management system.
