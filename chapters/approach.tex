\chapter{Approach}
\section{Related Works Study}
We will study works about asset allocation systems related to investors' risk preference or reinforcement learning model. The goal is to understand better the requirement, challenges, and opportunities for our design.
\section{System Design}
We will then design our system, including the input/output interface, utility function, with a deep reinforcement learning model. We will use an indicator to represent investors' risk preferences to adjust the utility function. We will adopt one of the existing commonly used and advanced models for the deep reinforcement learning model.
\section{Training and Validation}
We will define the market features as inputs for the system and select assets from the investable universe to build the portfolio. The goal is to choose assets with low correlations between each other. Hence their combinations can yield better profits from the same risk level.
We will split available data into two parts, the first parts used for training and the rest for validation.
\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
We will analyze the validation result with the MPT model to identify our design's strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, we will explore some opportunities for further improvement in our design.
