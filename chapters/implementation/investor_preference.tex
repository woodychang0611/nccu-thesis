\section{Investor Preference}
For investor preference, we will focus on the risk aversion of the investors. Usually, a professional organization will acquire risk aversion from investors by survey or other techniques and interprets the inputs into comparable indicators between investors.  Our system will use these indicators as input to build portfolios that meet investor preferences. We will use MDD as one of the performance indicators to evaluate our system. However, optimizing any ratio using MDD directly has many problems and challenges. Some researches indicate MDDs are outliers \cite {johansen2002large, johansen1998stock} or imply optimizing MDD is troublesome \cite{moody1998performance}. Therefore, we will limit ourselves to use MDD while optimizing the model and consider other alternatives.
