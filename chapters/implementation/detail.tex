Investments mean the investable universe for the portfolio management system. The goal is to choose investments with low correlations between each other; hence their combinations can yield better profits from the same risk level. We start from the top 100 ETFs by Asset Under Management (AUM) on March 2021 and remove ones with trading records of less than 14 years. We then obtain the top two most correlated ETFs and remove the one with lower AUM and continue the same process iteratively until 30 ETFs are left.  (\autoref{appendix:etfs})
