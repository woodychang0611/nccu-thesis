Investments mean the investable universe for the portfolio management system. The goal is to choose investments with low correlations between each other; hence their combinations can yield better profits from the same risk level. We start from the top 100 ETFs by Asset Under Management (AUM) and remove ones with trading records less than X years. We obtain the two ETFs with the highest correlation from the ETF left and remove the one with lower AUM iteratively until 30 ETFs are left.
