The RL-based Portfolio Management System contains two main parts, the training environment and the RL model. The trading environment bridges domain-specific inputs/outputs with the general-purpose RL model. This architecture enables the system to output the portfolio based on the inputs, the market, the investments, and the investor preference with most existing RL models.
