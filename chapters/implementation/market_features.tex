\section{Market Features}
For market features, the first part is the prices of investments we selected. We also include other indices to represent the status of markets, including Interest rates, commodity prices, stock market indexes, and currency exchange rates or indexes (\autoref{appendix:features_list}).
\par
For non-stationary data, we use statistics measures, including standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis among 5, 20, and 60 days.
