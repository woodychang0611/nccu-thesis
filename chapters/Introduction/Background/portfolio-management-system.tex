\subsection {Portfolio Management System}
A portfolio is a collection of financial investments. The goal of portfolio selection is to construct an optimal portfolio, which is usually different between investors due to their characteristics. Among these characteristics, risk preference is one of the significant factors. There are many indicators to represent the risk of the portfolio. Maximum Drawdown (MDD),  maximum loss from a peak over a given period, is a commonly used indicator of the risk.

Traditionally portfolio selection can be divided into two stages. First stage constructs the belief of future performance of available financial products. The second stage starts from the first stage and produces the choice of portfolio.  Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) introduced by  Harry Markowitz \cite{10.2307/2975974} focus on the second stage. Machine Learning (ML) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) can complete both stages in a single process and construct portfolios that out-performed the general market\cite{KRAUSS2017689}
