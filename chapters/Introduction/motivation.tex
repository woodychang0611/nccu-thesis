\section {Motivation}
Psychologically, humans favor avoiding losses to acquire equivalent gains. This tendency is called Loss Aversion.\cite{kahneman2000analysis} Kahneman's study suggests losses are twice as powerful as gains\cite{Tversky1992}. With Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), we can construct a portfolio that produces the maximum expected return from a given variance, an indicator of risk, or vice versa, the minimal variance from a given expected return\cite{10.2307/2975974}. MPT can construct portfolios fits different investors' preference.
Although many portfolio performance measures are risk-adjusted\cite{cogneau2009101}, like the Shape ratio\cite{Sharpe49} or the Sterling ratio\cite{magdon2004maximum}, most of them do not incorporate investors' risk preferences. Constructing portfolios based on investors' risk preferences will challenge machine learning models optimizing with these measures.
