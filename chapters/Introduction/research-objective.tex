\section {Research Objective}
This thesis aims to introduce an objective function and incorporate conventional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models to construct portfolios that fit investors with different risk preferences. The expected Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of the portfolio will represent investors' risk preferences and adjust the portfolio performance measure, which will be the objective function incorporate with DRL models to construct portfolios based on investors' risk preferences.
