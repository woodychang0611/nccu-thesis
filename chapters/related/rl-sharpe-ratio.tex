\section{Reinforcement Learning with Sharpe Ratio}
\cite{618952}
The differential Sharpe ratio \(D\) is defined as:
\[
\cfrac{d D_t}{d R_t} = 
\cfrac{B_{t-1}-A_{t-1} R_t}{(B_{t-1}-A_{t-1}^2)^\frac{3}{2}}
\]
where
A and B is the first and second moments of the returns' distributions
\[ A_n = \cfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nR_i\quad
B_n = \cfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nR_i^2
\]
