\section{Portfolio Allocation with Reinforcement Learning}

John Moody and Lizhong Wu introduced Reinforcement Learning for trading system \cite{618952}. Unlike supervised optimization techniques, reinforcement learning can incorporate the effects of transactions costs, taxes. They observed maximizing the differential Sharpe ratio yields more consistent results than maximizing profits.\cite{618952,moody1998performance} The differential Sharpe ratio \(D\) is defined as
\[
\cfrac{d D_t}{d R_t} = 
\cfrac{B_{t-1}-A_{t-1} R_t}{(B_{t-1}-A_{t-1}^2)^\frac{3}{2}}
\]
