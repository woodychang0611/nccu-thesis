\section{Holding and Transaction Costs}
The extra costs which we did not take into account are the holding costs and the transaction costs.
\par
The holding costs are the expenses paid to the ETF issuer for administration and operation. For most holding costs, ETFs are trivial; for example, SPY has a  gross expense ratio least than 0.1\%, and it is not the lowest among other ETFs. We assume holding costs is inconsequential to our result.
\par
The transaction costs are the costs during the transaction, including commission. Many ETFs are commission-free; we assume the transaction costs will not significantly impact our experiment result if we trade infrequently.
