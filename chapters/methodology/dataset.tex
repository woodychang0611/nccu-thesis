\section{Dataset}
\subsection{Data Collection}
We collected the historical adjusted closed prices of EFTs (\autoref{appendix:etfs_corr}) and market features (\autoref{appendix:features_list}) between 2007/4/20 til  2021/3/15 from Yahoo Finance and Federal Reserve Economic Data. We use data before 2017/2/28 as the training data and the rest as validation data.

\subsection{Data Processing}
The data we collected are structured data; we only need to fill the missing data with the nearest pass data and calculate statistics measures for non-stationary data.  All data processed are stored in files for further usage to improve efficiency.
