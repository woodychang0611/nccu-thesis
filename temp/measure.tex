\section{Measure}
\(DD_T\)\cite{moody2001learning}
\[
DD_T = \sqrt{\cfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^{T}{min\{R_T,0\}^2}}
\]

VaR (Value at Risk)\cite{CoherentMeasuresofRisk}
\[
VaR_\alpha(X) = -inf \{x |P[X\leq x\cdot r]>\alpha \}
\]
Measure
RISK TOLERANCE FUNCTIONS\cite{elton2009modern}

\[f=\bar{R}-\frac{\tau^2}{T} \]
where T is referred to as risk tolerance and expresses the investor’s trade-off between
expected return and variance of return. 
\par
SAFETY FIRST\cite{elton2009modern}
If \(R_P\) is the return on the portfolio and \(R_L\) is the level below which the investor does not wish returns
to fall, Roy’s criterion is
\[Minimize P(R_p<R_L) \]
