I strongly appreciate the support from Professor Hu; he guided me to complete the thesis from scratch and provided precious suggestions. A great appreciation to the Department of Computer Science, NCCU delivers valuable programs to build competence in-depth and my classmates for giving insight finance knowledge. Thanks to Computer and Infomation Center Network Center, providing the infrastructure also offers crucial support for me to complete the study.

Special thanks to ASML, my manager, and my colleagues for supporting me through this period to fulfill my duty efficiently while spending lots of time in school.

Most importantly, I would like to thank my family, especially my wife, Anita, for encouraging me to take and complete the challenges.
