The distributed ledger has been widely used in different scenarios after the Bitcoin turns out.
Unlike the Proof of work (PoW) approaches, there’s another mechanism that used to implement on the decentralize database or fault-tolerate system that have great potential to be transplanted to nowadays consortium blockchain systems.
The research focus on the applying of consensus algorithm to financial organizations with the asynchronous network condition, byzantine attackers and permissioned policy in the system.
We designed a novel algorithm that can tolerate at most no more than one third faulty nodes within the system, which is similar to the previous works but will have better performance base on our mathematical analysis and results of experiences.\\
