The goal of portfolio management diverse among different investors. Acceptable risk is one of the key factors. Max Drawdown (MDD) is one of the concrete definitions for risk. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising machine learning approach for portfolio selection. Instead of using investment return as a reward function directly, many models use Sharpe Ratio \cite{Sharpe49} or Sterling ratio instead, which have taken variability into account. However, neither Sharpe ratio nor Sterling ratio has no inputs to raise or reduce the influence of risk upon the reward function. Therefore the model using Sharpe Ratio \cite{Sharpe49} or Sterling ratio cannot reflect the needs of different investor types that have different tolerance to risk.

In this thesis, we introduce a reward function for Portfolio Management RL model which includes the influence of MDD as its parameters.
