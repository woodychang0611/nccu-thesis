Requirements for portfolio management is different among different investors. Risk is one of the critical factors. Max Drawdown (MDD), the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, is a commonly used risk indicator. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising machine learning approach for portfolio selection. Instead of using investment return as a reward function directly, many models use indicators that have taken variability into account, like Sharpe Ratio \cite{Sharpe49} or Sterling ratio. However, neither Sharpe ratio nor Sterling ratio has inputs to raise or reduce risk's influence upon the reward function. Therefore the model using Sharpe Ratio \cite{Sharpe49} or Sterling ratio cannot reflect the needs of investor types with different tolerance to risk.

This thesis introduces a reinforcement learning reward function for portfolio management that incorporates different risk levels represented in target maximum drawdown.
